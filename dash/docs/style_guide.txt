Use four spaces per indentation level.
Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
Separate top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
Encode files using ASCII or UTF-8.
Use one module import per import statement and per line. Place import statements at the top of the file, after comments and docstrings, grouped first by standard, then by third party, and finally by local library imports.
Do not use extraneous whitespaces between parentheses, square brackets, or braces or before commas.
Write class names in camel case (e.g., CamelCase), suffix exceptions with Error (if applicable), and name functions in lowercase with words and underscores (e.g., separated_by_underscores). Use a leading underscore for _private attributes or methods.
